The country was up in arms, the war was on, in \nevery breast burned the holy fire of patriotism; the drums wer e beating, the bands playing, the toy \npistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and sputtering; on every hand and far down the \nreceding and fading spreads of roofs and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the \nsun; daily the young v olunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new \nuniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices \nchoked with happy emotion as they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened, \npanting, t o patriot oratory which stirred the deepest deeps of their hearts and which they \ninterrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of applause, the tears running down their cheeks the \nwhile; in the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country a nd invoked the God of \nBattles, beseeching His aid in our good cause in outpouring of fervid eloquence which moved \nevery listener.  \n    It was indeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to \ndisapprove of the war and cast a  doubt upon its righteousness straightway got such a stern and \nangry warning that for their personal safety's sake they quickly shrank out of sight and offended \nno more in that way.  \n    Sunday morning came - next day the battalions would leave for the fro nt; the church was filled; \nthe volunteers were there, their faces alight with material dreams - visions of a stern advance, the \ngathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the flight of the foe, the tumult, the \nenveloping smoke, the fierce  pursuit, the surrender! - then home from the war, bronzed heros, \nwelcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! With the volunteers sat their dear ones, \nproud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth  \nto the field of honor, there to win for the flag or, failing, die the noblest of noble deaths. The \nservice proceeded; a war chapter from the Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it \nwas followed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one impulse the house rose, \nwith glowing eyes and beating hearts, and poured out that tremendous invocation -- \"God the all -\nterrible! Thou who ordainest, Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!\"  \n    Then came the \"long\" prayer. None could rememb er the like of it for passionate pleading and \nmoving and beautiful language.

With all eyes following him and wondering, he made his silent way; without \npausing, he ascended to the preacher's side and stood there, waiting.  \n    With shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence, continued his m oving prayer, and at \nlast finished it with the words, uttered in fervent appeal,\"Bless our arms, grant us the victory, O \nLord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!\"  \n    The stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside - which the sta rtled minister did - and \ntook his place.

you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I  \nwalked down the sidestreets under the trees with a headache  \nself-conscious looking at the full moon.  \n  In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into  \nthe neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations!  \n  What peaches and what penumbras!  Whole families shopping at  \nnight!  Aisles full of husbands!  Wives  in the avocados,  \nbabies in the tomatoes! --and you, Garcia Lorca, what were you  \ndoing down by the watermelons?  \n \n  I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber,  \npoking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the  \ngrocery boys.  \n  I heard yo u asking questions of each:  Who killed the pork  \nchops?  What price bananas?  Are you my Angel?  \n  I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans  \nfollowing you, and followed in my imagination by the store  \ndetective.  \n  We strode down the open corrid ors together in our solitary  \nfancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy,  \nand never passing the cashier.  \n  Where are we going Walt Whitman?

The best\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\nlarge and limited training data.\n\u2217Equal contribution.

Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n2", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4260, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b9555b1-ff70-4c3a-92db-a1eebd7ef473": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b9555b1-ff70-4c3a-92db-a1eebd7ef473", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54a373ba-3db0-4a20-9ea8-b919d0ff590e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "hash": "830dbbdba6c33da6579fe45c957b3aba4ad2905c45509fb72946ea7469b97280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nquery with all keys, divide each by\u221adk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\n\u221adk)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof1\u221adk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1\u221adk.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

For each of these we use\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\u2022In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[38, 2, 9].\n\u2022The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n\u2022Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \u2212\u221e) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\ndff= 2048 .\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by\u221admodel.\n5", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3169, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa3e9d7c-765c-43b4-ba9a-803478aeda1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa3e9d7c-765c-43b4-ba9a-803478aeda1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "07b8a87e-4f02-45f5-9e24-d3cf0b513a68", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "hash": "9aac5c8f9ff586e87011f1dcbb7f5a6808995bcb4736005ea96b69ba001ff21b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\nOperations\nSelf-Attention O(n2\u00b7d) O(1) O(1)\nRecurrent O(n\u00b7d2) O(n) O(n)\nConvolutional O(k\u00b7n\u00b7d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r\u00b7n\u00b7d) O(1) O(n/r)\n3.5 Positional Encoding\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\nlearned and fixed [9].\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\u03c0to10000 \u00b72\u03c0. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\nPEpos.\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi\u2208Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n6", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3448, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11add8b3-00fd-4325-b23f-4b11db6617b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "11add8b3-00fd-4325-b23f-4b11db6617b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2513c34-0028-4755-867d-8462b3447cf0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "hash": "726b78eb2d3f5288f9492cab25cda1f9b5fddf3e464aa055456f27b65102131d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "length nis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n[38] and byte-pair [ 31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k\u00b7n\u00b7d+n\u00b7d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\n5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\ntarget tokens.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n5.3 Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with \u03b21= 0.9,\u03b22= 0.98and\u03f5= 10\u22129. We varied the learning\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\nlrate =d\u22120.5\nmodel\u00b7min(step_num\u22120.5, step _num\u00b7warmup _steps\u22121.5) (3)\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\n5.4 Regularization\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n7", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3305, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0909c34b-f030-4d7c-a725-191011c4254f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0909c34b-f030-4d7c-a725-191011c4254f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03c53c93-65d0-4ce5-b53d-11667078e22b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "hash": "2ba95835a0d35f6f157c542911095326af4dc748cbe75b86b2c2376697cfc885", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\nModelBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\nByteNet [18] 23.75\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0\u00b71020\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3\u00b710191.4\u00b71020\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6\u00b710181.5\u00b71020\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0\u00b710191.2\u00b71020\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0\u00b71020\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8\u00b710201.1\u00b71021\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7\u00b710191.2\u00b71021\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3\u00b71018\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3\u00b71019\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\nsub-layer input and normalized.

This\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n6 Results\n6.1 Machine Translation\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\nthe competitive models.\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty \u03b1= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\n6.2 Model Variations\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\n8", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3149, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3aa97665-d10c-4a5d-93cb-e069dd947fd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3aa97665-d10c-4a5d-93cb-e069dd947fd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fdb6c5a5-e893-4348-8af0-ee3b872b1206", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2215244, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "hash": "d175c28c23776f0ebe1fe12827fdde36479e797ff86c8adc074f310d472609a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\n[37].

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video.

It is a benefit that, while  important, is of a lesser \norder. It is to contribute to the defense of the nation. It is nothing so complex and so grand as the social order or the price mechanism within it.

By publishing this article at the dawn of the new millennium, the  Journal of Political Economy  suggests how far the discipline of \neconomics may be from fathoming its origins and even its presuppositions. \nTo combat Grampp\u2019s iconoclastic agenda, I shall present a detailed \nelaboration of Smith\u2019s three references to an invisible hand. After criticizing Grampp\u2019s attempt to narrow the grasp of the invisible hand within The \nWealth of Nations (WN), I turn to his account of the invisible hand in Smith\u2019s \nother book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments  (TMS ). Although Grampp\u2019s \ninterpretation of this book errs palpably, it raises questions that can help us \nfathom the long-disputed tension\u2014about the worthiness of wealth and the \nplight of the poor\u2014between The Theory of Moral Sentiments  (1759), which \nextols God along with love and benevolence, and  The Wealth of Nations \n(1776), which expels God and emphasiz es self-interest. I conclude by \naddressing the posthumously published essay in which Smith attributes \nbelief in invisible hands to supersti tious \u201csavages\u201d and thus seems to \nimpugn the appeals to an invisible hand in his own books. \n \n \n \n\u201cIN MANY OTHER CASES\u201d \n \n \nHowever tempting it is to regard th e invisible hand as a metaphor/simile \nfor Smith\u2019s whole project, Grampp prudently focuses our attention on the \nprecise context in which the invisible hand manifests itself. He concludes \nthat the invisible hand does not have \u201ca principal place\u201d or even a \u201csalient\u201d \none in Wealth of Nations  (442). \nThe key chapter\u2014\u201cOf Restraints up on the Importation from foreign \nCountries of such Goods as can be produced at Home\u201d (IV.ii)\u2014is the first \nof a series in Book IV that criticize mercantilist policies.

( WN \n456) \n \nFor Grampp, the unintended public benefit the invisible hand promotes is the domestic  build-up of capital (Grampp 452). His Abstract goes so far as to \nassert that Smith\u2019s invisible hand is  \u201csimply\u201d the \u201cinducement a merchant \nhas to keep his capital at home, thereby increasing the domestic capital stock and enhancing military power\u201d (441). \nEarlier in the chapter, Smith laments that import restrictions create \nmonopolies (for domestic producers) that channel a society\u2019s capital in sub-\noptimal ways. The typical reader of Wealth of Nations  understands Smith\u2019s \npoint that a capital owner, by directing his industry \u201cin such a manner as its \nproduce may be of the greatest value . . . intends only his own gain.\u201d Grampp is right to observe that this chapter emphasizes the owner\u2019s \nincentives to deploy capital domestica lly. Smith states th at, upon \u201cequal or \nnearly equal profits,\u201d any wholesale merchant \u201cnaturally prefers the home-\ntrade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of \nconsumption to the carrying trade.\u201d Smith offers several plausible reasons \nin explaining the merchant\u2019s posture: among other things, the merchant can \nmore easily know \u201cthe laws of the country from which he must seek redress\u201d and \u201cthe character and situation\u201d of the people he has to rely upon \n(WN 454). \nGrampp carefully summarizes nine ways that scholars have \ninterpreted the invisible hand; he faults all of them for perceiving an \ninvisible hand in other situations Smith describes whereby someone \u201cintends only his own gain\u201d but ends up producing benefit to others. For \nGrampp, by contrast, an invisible hand \u201cguides a merchant only when \ncircumstances induce him to keep his capital at home\u201d (447). One \nprominent obstacle Grampp must confront is Smith\u2019s statement that an invisible hand operates \u201cin many other cases\u201d to promote an end that the \n383                                                                           VOLUME 1, NUMBER 3, DECEMBER 2004", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2600, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0484490-b8ca-4b92-83e9-af9414d327d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0484490-b8ca-4b92-83e9-af9414d327d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1053d3-7165-47ba-b898-cac1e5d44b14", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "hash": "20e84abae481a6e699c24f2f31c12a0712e32ba34345e3eb45544a092f20748c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "PETER MINOWITZ  \nrelevant agent did not intend. Grampp\u2019s response is unpersuasive, not least \nbecause it is convoluted. \n \nDoes the word \u201ccases\u201d mean there are transactions, other than placing capital in competitive domestic trade, that add to domestic wealth and to de fense? Or does \u201ccases\u201d mean \nthat transactions that place capital in domestic trade \ncontribute to something other than defense, for example, \nto what he calls elsewhere the \u201cgreatness\u201d of the nation? \nOr does the word have all three meanings? (Grampp 452) \n \nLet me offer a guess about what Grampp here envisions as the three \n\u201cmeanings\u201d that \u201ccases\u201d can have: capital allocated to competitive domestic \ntrade; other \u201ctransactions\u201d that promote domestic wealth and defense; \ncapital, allocated to competitive domestic trade, that contributes to national \ngreatness or another public end (beyond national defense). \nI credit Grampp for emphasizing the rhetorical weight Smith puts, in \nthe build-up to the invisible hand, on fear of capital flight, but Grampp \nneglects three aspects of the chapter that inspire many readers to conceive \nthe invisible hand more broadly. First, although the paragraph emphasizes \nthe allocation of capital\u2014an activity that some people, e.g., \u201cthose who live by wages\u201d ( WN 86, 266) are not equipped to undertake\u2014the quoted \nsection begins with two references to \u201cevery individual,\u201d including the \nremarkable claim that \u201cevery individual\u201d (not just every merchant or \ninvestor) \u201cnecessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as \ngreat as he can.\u201d Second, the paragra ph concludes with Smith stating, \u201cI \nhave never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the \npublick good\u201d (456). If Grampp\u2019s interp retation were correct, the paragraph \nshould instead conclude with Smith saying, \u201cI have never known much \ngood done by those who affected to trade to augment domestic capital and \nthereby promote national defense.\u201d By here questioning the accomplishments \nof individuals who claimed that they were trading to promote \u201cthe publick \ngood\u201d generally, Smith suggests that an invisible hand may operate to produce a variety of public benefits.\n1 The conclusion of the paragraph \n                                                                                        \n1 When Smith, via the pronoun \u201cI,\u201d makes himself conspicuous in his paragraph on an \ninvisible  hand\u2014and when he invokes what he knows about consequences of which the \nimmediate actors are ignorant \u2014he encourages readers to pay special attention. It remains true \nthat the clause containing the invisible hand refers to \u201can end that was no part of his \nintention\u201d without specifying that this end involves  benefit to the public .

Third, a few pages earlier the chapter \nseems to anticipate the invisible hand with a paragraph that ignores the \ndistinction between domestic  and foreign investment. \n \nEvery individual is continually exerting himself to find out \nthe most advantageous employment for whatever capital \nhe can command. It is his own advantage, indeed, and not \nthat of the society, which he has in view.

The stateman [ sic], who should attempt to \ndirect private people in what manner they ought to employ \ntheir capitals, would not only load himself with a most \nunnecessary attention, but assume an authority which \ncould safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to \nno council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly \n                                                                                       \nsupports the common view\u2014that the invisible hand is a pivotal concept in WN\u2014rather \nthan Grampp\u2019s attempt to narrow the hand\u2019s reach. \n385                                                                           VOLUME 1, NUMBER 3, DECEMBER 2004", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2259, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7f35f93-a5a4-482f-9c74-4adbd74857a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7f35f93-a5a4-482f-9c74-4adbd74857a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9d983efb-0407-479d-b6ad-42f8371fdfc5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "hash": "89ae2ab1703f21aadce9ba7c3ed00884daace15a7df1fd8ec41ae55619acac1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "PETER MINOWITZ  \nand presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it. \n(WN 456, emphasis added)2\n \nThus, even in the immediate context that Grampp emphasizes,3 Smith \nprovides ample provocation for extending the application of the invisible hand. At several points, ironically, Grampp himself offers a ridiculously universalized statement, as if led by Smith\u2019s authorial hand to overuse the \nword \u201cevery\u201d and thus exaggerate the scope of the invisible hand\u2019s \nbenevolence. According to Grampp, Smith summons the invisible hand when describing a \u201ccondition . . . in which a man who intends to benefit only himself in a particular way may, in the act of procuring that benefit, \nproduce a benefit of a different kind for everyone  including himself\u201d \n(Grampp 443, emphasis added).\n4 Even confining our attention to the \ndomestic front, it is difficult to specify a commercial transaction that would \nyield a benefit for a nation\u2019s entire population. Smith in IV.ii does use a \nvariety of terms in describing large groupings of people,5 and praise what \n\u201cevery\u201d individual  can contribute by seeking profitable investments.6 But the \n                                                                                        \n2 Smith uses similar terminology later in Book IV when he states that \u201cthe law ought always \nto trust people with the care of their own inte rest, as in their local situations they must \ngenerally be able to judge better of it than the legislator can do\u201d (531). His main targets here, \nhowever, are laws that required farmers to sell their grain directly, without the intermediation \nof dealers; there\u2019s nothing about a merchant keeping his capital at home (Grampp 447) and \nthus promoting national defense (Grampp 441, 443). Contra Grampp, it seems natural for \nthe reader here to recall the invisible hand that Smith earlier invoked to discourage legislators \nfrom meddling. \n3 While Grampp concedes that many common reflections about the invisible hand are \n\u201crelated to\u201d ideas that are \u201cin the Wealth of Nations , somewhere or other,\u201d he complains that \nthese ideas typically are not \u201cideas that Smit h himself made a part of it\u201d (Grampp 442). I\u2019m \nnot sure how one can definitively specify the ideas that Smith \u201cmade a part of\u201d the invisible \nhand, but one should at least scrutinize the chapter in which the invisible hand appears. \nWhen Grampp turns to The Theory of Moral Sentiments, as I\u2019ll shortly elaborate, his reading of \nits \u201cinvisible hand\u201d passage is embarrassingly lazy, in part because he ignores the profound questions Smith poses nearby. \n4Grampp similarly misuses the term \u201cevery one\u201d on pp. 450, 451, and perhaps 459, though \nhe provides a subtler overview on p. 444. \n5 In WN IV.ii, Smith refers to the proper names of several European nations and peoples; he \nalso employs the following \u201ccollective\u201d terms: ki ngdom, society, country, state, \u201cthe interest \nof a nation,\u201d \u201cthe publick interest,\u201d \u201cthe publick good,\u201d \u201cthe circumstances of the people,\u201d \u201cthe general good,\u201d \u201cour manufacturers,\u201d and \u201cus.\u201d The last two phrases refer to Britain; \nSmith laments the \u201cmonopoly which our manufacturers have obtained against us\u201d  (WN \n471). \n6 In the previously discussed passage from WN IV.ii that anticipates the invisible hand, \nSmith himself exaggerates the public benefit that \u201cevery\u201d investor brings. We read that every individual is continually striving to discern \u201cthe most advantageous\u201d employment for his \nECON JOURNAL WATCH                                                                                                           386", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3584, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fa16a83-93ed-4930-a68a-b262889ae3d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fa16a83-93ed-4930-a68a-b262889ae3d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a87edebe-75ba-414f-9694-e8ea73530097", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "hash": "b8fbc9881910396858efc7da6e6bc2cc4a69f82afb9a76fb4f2778e9a1ca12b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "INVISIBLE HAND \nwords \u201ceveryone\u201d and \u201ceverybody\u201d never appear.

He \nelaborates that the individual profiled in the invisible-hand paragraph would  \nunderstand how keeping his capital at home boosts domestic employment \nand output. The consequence the capital-owner would not fathom is the \npossible augmentation of his nation\u2019s power  (Grampp 454).7 How does \n                                                                                       \ncapital, and that his quest to promote his own advantage \u201cnecessarily\u201d directs him to the \nemployment that is \u201cmost advantageous\u201d to the society ( WN 454).

If a methamphetamine dealer earns a windfall by \nhatching brilliant new techniques for production  and distribution, does his contribution to \nthe proliferation of \u201ccrank\u201d addicts constitute a major contribution to American society? On WN\u2019s tendency to deploy terms such as advantageous, proper, improved, interest, greatness, \nand justice in a materialistic or \u201ceconomisti c\u201d fashion, see Minowitz 1993, 15-17, 34, 37-39, \n46. \n7 I feel compelled to point out that WN\u2019s invisible-hand paragraph refers only once to what \nthe agent knows , but four times to what he intends \u2014and once to his intention. Grampp \nsimilarly stumbles later when he implies that the invisible hand has only one unintended consequence, \u201cto contribute to the defense of  the nation\u201d (Grampp 446).

To these passages (and others like them),\n8 \nGrampp adds considerations he admits are only inferences. Apparently drawing on the invisible-hand paragraph\u2019s invocation of the capital owner\u2019s \n\u201csecurity,\u201d Grampp infers that domestic capital is more \u201csecure\u201d than \ncapital held abroad because it can more  easily or reliably be marshaled to \n\u201csupport\u201d defense (by funding m ilitary expenditures, I presume).\n9 But when \nSmith in his earlier chapter on \u201cthe natural progress of opulence\u201d describes \nthe differences in security among capital invested in land (highest), \nmanufacturing (middle), and foreign commerce (lowest), his focus is on the \nsituation of the owner , not the nation.10\nAlthough Grampp may here go astray by confounding the nation\u2019s \nsecurity with the merchant\u2019s, he is on  much firmer ground when he invokes \nthe grim conclusion of Wealth of Nations , Book III (Grampp 459).

Smith\u2019s emphasis in IV.ii on unintended \nconsequences figures prominently in many of the nine interpretations Grampp attacks. \n8 Grampp usefully cites Smith\u2019s claim \u201cthe great object of the political oeconomy of every \ncountry, is to encrease the riches and the power of that country\u201d ( WN 372). Also crucial are \nSmith\u2019s statement that defens e is \u201cthe first duty of the sovereign\u201d (689) and his \nincorporation of societal \u201cgreatness\u201d (along with wealth) within \u201cthe great purpose\u201d that \nevery political economy \u201csyste m\u201d intends to promote (687). \n9 Grampp also hypothesizes that boosting domestic employment promotes national defense \nbecause workers abroad would be harder to  summon for military service (Grampp 453). \n10 WN 377-79.

If his main focus had been on military power, \nwhy would Smith offer his knowledge to all \u201cnations\u201d indiscriminately? It is possible, albeit unlikely, that most nations could be well defended, but \nmilitary \u201cpower\u201d also includes offensive capabilities; and millions of people \nhave believed that economic liberty as touted by Smith serves to benefit \nsome nations at the expense of other nations.

In Book IV, Smith \npersistently attacks what he alleges are the zero-sum aspects of \nmercantilism\u2014its agendas for imperi alism and colonization (588, 613, 626-\n7), its obsession with self-sufficiency (435, 456-7, 458, 493, 538-9) and \u201cthe \nbalance of trade\u201d (431-2, 450, 488- 9, 642), its appeals to \u201cnational \nprejudice\u201d and \u201cnational animosity\u201d (474, 475, 494, 495, 496, 503), and its \npremise that trading nations advance their \u201cinterest\u201d by \u201cbeggaring all their \nneighbours\u201d (493). His alternative is the \u201cfreedom of trade\u201d (433, 464, 469, 580) that would allow many nations, if not all, collectivel y to advance \u201cthe \naccommodation and conveniency of the species\u201d (30) and \u201cthe business of \nmankind\u201d (592) via \u201cthe mutual communication of knowledge and of all \nsorts of improvements which an extens ive commerce from all countries to \nall countries naturally, or rather necessarily, carries along with it\u201d (627).

Hayek credits Smith (and other \n18th-century Scots) for showing that \u201can evident order which was not the product of a \ndesigning human intelligence need not therefore be ascribed to the design of a higher \nsupernatural intelligence.\u201d Because \u201cno human mind can comprehend all the knowledge which guides the actions of society,\u201d Hayek exhorts us to conceive of \u201can effective \ncoordination of human activities without deliberate organization by a commanding \nintelligence\u201d; such coordination often occurs via an \u201cimpersonal mechanism\u201d such as a \nmarket (Hayek 1959, 4, 59, 159). Emphasiz ing the limits on the knowledge a human \nindividual can attain, Hayek (like Smith) encour ages his readers to assume \u201can attitude of \nhumility towards the impersonal and anonymous so cial processes by which individuals help \nto create things greater than they know.\u201d These \u201cimpersonal and anonymous\u201d processes \nwould include languages, markets, and a variety of laws and customs (Hayek 1948, 7, 8, 11, \n15, 22, 32, 86-88). Hayek could complain that Smith\u2019s appeals to an invisible hand, \u201cthe \nwisdom of nature\u201d ( WN 674), and so on, may encourage readers to mis-identify impersonal \nsocial processes as a superhuman intellig ence that leads or directs us. Although TMS  goes \nfurther with its frequent appeals to a superhuman designer , it anticipates Hayek by explaining \nhow moral consciousness and conduct can emerge via the purely human interactions that \ncreate \u201cthe impartial spectator.\u201d For a penetrating discussion of Hayek in connection with \nSmith\u2019s invisible hand, see Roth schild 2001, 140-2, 145-53, 155. \n391                                                                           VOLUME 1, NUMBER 3, DECEMBER 2004", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3192, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1712a4e-ca8f-436f-94be-0f1ad4eb3c72": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1712a4e-ca8f-436f-94be-0f1ad4eb3c72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c5cd81ae-b72c-4ced-b263-ba5cec8527ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "hash": "6fd752f776186138c73bd30c1df20d8dccc67def0a1c3e74ff98a837a476f51e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "PETER MINOWITZ  \nin this book does Smith invite the reader to imagine an invisible hand that \nfulfills the intentions of a superhum an being\u2014and that shows particular \ncare for the poor.

He is  right to challenge the plausibility \nof the Moral Sentiments  version, but he ignores the disturbing lessons \nsuggested by the surrounding material, and he goes embarrassingly astray in \nlaying out the particulars. \n                                                                                        \n14 However difficult it would have been for Smith to prove this thesis when he wrote, it \nwould be harder for someone today to argue that the soil \u201cmaintains at all times nearly that \nnumber of inhabitants which it is capable of  maintaining.\u201d Millions are obese, while millions \nare starving.

Our population has grown because \u201cnature\u201d \ntricked us into laboring that transforms the earth, partly by multiplying the \nearth\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d fertility. The invisible hand serves to maintain \u201cthe \nmultiplication of the species\u201d in the fa ce of widespread landlessness.

Nature wields its power and achieves its ends in \ncomplex if not paradoxical ways. Adam Smith grasps the two disparate \nperspectives on wealth and greatness: the \u201csplenetic\u201d negative perspective \nand the \u201ccomplex\u201d positive one. Unlike the rich, he cares for the poor; unlike most of us (including the poor man\u2019s son afflicted by ambition), he is never intoxicated by the \u201ctrinkets of frivolous utility.\u201d\n20\nSmith\u2019s contribution is philosophical, one may infer, since he \nfathoms the paradoxical truths about how everything fits together.

Seventy-three years before the Journal of Political Economy  published Grampp\u2019s article, it \npublished \u201cAdam Smith and Laissez Faire,\u201d a pioneering article by Jacob Viner. Viner \nskillfully displays the theological clash (and some related differences) between Smith\u2019s two \nbooks, but exaggerates both the optimism and the dogmatism in TMS . In faulting TMS  for \n\u201cabsolutism\u201d and \u201crigidity\u201d (Viner 1958, 216), Viner ignores the complex dialectics of the \ntrinkets puzzle. He likewise overstates the extent to which TMS  posits \u201cuniversal and perfect \nharmony\u201d and presents an \u201cunqualified doctrine of a harmonious order of nature, under \ndivine guidance\u201d (217, 220, 222-23). Viner overlooks mankind\u2019s continual vulnerability to \n\u201cthe winter storm,\u201d anxiety, fear, sorrow, disease, danger, and death ( TMS  183). In addition, \nhe overemphasizes the passages ( TMS  105, 166, 168) that identify the happiness  and perfection \nof \u201cthe world\u201d and its \u201cspecies\u201d as the purposes of Nature/God (Viner 1958, 217, 220, 229-\n30); and he ignores the passages that highlight individual preservation and species \npropagation ( TMS  77, 87), humbler goods that resemble WN\u2019s humbler articulation of \u201cthe \nwisdom of nature\u201d (WN  673-74; see pages 408-409 below). Like Grampp, finally, Viner is \ntoo quick to invoke Smith\u2019s alleged \u201cabsentmindedness\u201d to explain inconsistencies (Viner \n1958, 241). Anyone who savors the delicacy of Smith\u2019s prose, and tracks the multitude of \nminute changes Smith made in revising his two books, has no reason to doubt his 1788 \ndescription of his approach as an author: \u201cI am a slow a very slow workman, who do and \nundo everything I write at least a half a dozen of times\u201d (Letter to Thomas Cadell, 15 March \n1788).

It turns out that our \u201clove of system\u201d\u2014our attraction to the \u201cbeauty of order, art and contrivance,\u201d the attraction that helps wealth and greatness seduce us\u2014can \nfruitfully be manipulated to \u201cimplant public virtue in the breast of him who \nseems heedless of the interest of his country.\u201d To do this, you could \nproceed by describing \u201cthe great system\u201d of public policy that helps feed, \nclothe, and house \u201cthe subjects of a well-governed state.\u201d After explaining \n\u201cthe connections and dependencies of its several parts\u2026and their general \nsubservience to the happiness of the society,\u201d you could \u201cshow how this \nsystem might be introduced into his own country,\u201d describing the current \n\u201cobstructions\u201d and how they might be removed so that \u201cthe wheels of the \nmachine of government\u201d would \u201cmove with more harmony and \nsmoothness\u201d ( TMS  185-86). From Smith\u2019s point of view, obviously, Wealth \nof Nations  is well suited to \u201cimplant public  virtue\u201d along these lines. But this \nbook also calls upon the invisible hand, and many powerful arguments, to \ninoculate kings, princes, legislators, and statesmen from the \u201cinnumerable \ndelusions\u201d that would afflict anyone who sought to superintend the \u201cindustry of private people\u201d ( WN 687). \nA similar warning, which particular ly seems to challenge Part IV\u2019s \nsuggestions about using the \u201clove of syst em\u201d to bolster civic virtue, suffuses \nsome passages in Part VI of Moral Sentiments , which Smith added for the \n1790 edition. People \u201cintoxicated by the imaginary beauty\u201d of an \u201cideal \nsystem,\u201d Smith now warns, often succu mb to \u201cthe madness of fanaticism\u201d \n(TMS  232). The \u201cman of system\u201d who ig nores \u201cthe great interests\u201d or \n\u201cstrong prejudices\u201d that may oppose his \u201cideal plan of government,\u201d furthermore, treats people as \u201cthe hand  arranges the different pieces upon a \nchess-board\u201d (note the impact of a visible hand). Such a man fails to \nrecognizes that \u201cin the great chess-bo ard of human society, every single \npiece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might chuse [ sic] to impress upon it\u201d (234). \n \n \n   \n \nECON JOURNAL WATCH                                                                                                           398", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2623, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a6d5cc5-c359-4174-a64e-eddfebc9b640": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a6d5cc5-c359-4174-a64e-eddfebc9b640", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7328b228-f83a-4b6b-961b-2f11e6bcc04c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "hash": "0c7aa19b1210e5a52bfb2cc5ff0fdb7767108317e53354122ed00652edeff98b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "INVISIBLE HAND \n\u201cA FEW LORDLY MASTERS\u201d \n \n \nBy invoking an invisible hand to drive home human shortcomings in \npower, wisdom, and virtue, Part IV of Moral Sentiments  communicates a \nlesson that most religions emphasize. And in the sentence after the one that \ndescribes the invisible hand, Smith incorporates a divine presence missing \nfrom Wealth of Nations . As he did in the preceding sentences, Smith \nreassures his readers about the fate of the masses deprived of land (and \npower). \n \nWhen Providence divided the earth among a few lordly \nmasters, it neither forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left ou t in the partition\u2026.

Bu t the torments of our origins recur \neven in the last two stages.21\nIn his most detailed discussion of food shortages, Smith focuses on \nthe experience of Europe during recent centuries. He concedes that \u201cdearths\u201d have arisen from \u201creal scarcity\u201d caused sometimes by \u201cthe waste \nof war\u201d but more often by \u201cthe fault of the seasons\u201d; such scarcity can be \nameliorated but not eliminated ( WN 526-7). By blaming the seasons for \ndearths, Smith is blaming nature. Famine, on the other hand, \u201chas never \narisen from any other cause but the violence of government attempting, by \nimproper means, to remedy the inconveniences of a dearth\u201d (526). By tracing famines to abusive governments, Smith paves the way for nature\u2019s \nremedy\u2014the \u201cunlimited, unrestrained freedom of the corn trade\u201d\u2014which \nis also the \u201cbest palliative\u201d of dearths (527; cf. 538). \nWhen he discusses subsistence and propagation in general terms, \nbeyond the current situation in Europe, Smith likewise leaves us with \nquestions about how nature and human institutions interact. One dilemma \nsociety confronts is that, as \u201c[e]very species of animals naturally multiplies \nin proportion to the means of their subsistence\u201d ( WN 97), prosperity causes \nchildhood mortality to decr ease, which eventually causes wages to decrease. \nIn a stationary economy, the \u201cgreat body of the people\u201d merely subsist; in a \ndecaying economy they die off (86-8,  90-1, 97-9). Smith suggests China as \nan example of the stationary state. It \u201chas long been one of the richest, that \nis, one of the most fertile, best cu ltivated, most industrious, and most \npopulous countries in the world\u201d; yet centuries before Smith\u2019s time, it had \n\u201cperhaps\u2026acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its \n                                                                                        \n21 The four-stages theory is infused by somethin g like an invisible hand insofar as Smith says \nnothing to suggest that human leaders or visionaries have played, or are needed to play, a \nrole in propelling society from one stage to the next (cf.

Consider first the herding stage: a \u201cTartar chief, the increase of whose herds and flocks is sufficient to \nmaintain a thousand men,\u201d cannot exchange his surplus \u201crude produce\u201d for \n\u201cany manufactured produce, any trinkets and baubles.\u201d He therefore employs the surplus by \u201cmaintaining a thousand men,\u201d who in exchange can provide only obedience; the chie f\u2019s authority becomes \u201caltogether \ndespotical\u201d ( WN 712-13).\n25\nIn its early moments, the agricultural stage features shepherd-like \npolitical arrangements: the \u201csovereign or chief\u201d is simply \u201cthe greatest \nlandlord of the country.\u201d One example is \u201cour German and Scythian \nancestors when they first settled upon the ruins of the western empire\u201d \n(WN 717). Smith elaborates this  earlier, in Book III, where he provides his \nmost detailed discussion of the relationship between lords and their subordinates. A \u201cgreat proprietor\u201d in feudal Europe, lacking access to \nforeign commerce and \u201cthe finer manufactures,\u201d consumed his entire \nsurplus in \u201crustick hospitality\u201d that in effect purchased the allegiance of \nservants along with a \u201cmultitude of retainers and dependents\u201d (413-14). The \nfeudal proprietor thus rese mbles the shepherd chief. \nAccording to Moral Sentiments , Providence \u201cdivided the earth among a \nfew lordly masters.\u201d This description could not apply to the hunting stage, as presented by Wealth of Nations , for two reasons: there are no lordly \nmasters who own the land, and widespread poverty inhibits \u201cthe \nmultiplication of the species\u201d ( TMS  184-85). As we have seen, however, the \ndescription does apply to the herdin g stage\u2014except that the \u201cmasters\u201d here \nmonopolize herds rather than fixed tracts of land.\n26 And the description \n                                                                                        \n25 Such a \u201clittle sovereign\u201d ends up being supported by \u201ca sort of little nobility\u201d: \u201cMen of \ninferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their \nproperty, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the \npossession of theirs\u201d ( WN 715). \n26 WN also refers to \u201cthe original state of things, which precedes both the appropriation of \nland and the accumulation of stock\u201d; here a laborer is not required to share his produce with \neither \u201clandlord or master\u201d ( WN 82). The hunting/fishing stage seems to fit these criteria; in \nthe second stage, the \u201cchief\u201d controls the herds and their produce; in the hunting stage, \nthere is \u201clittle or no authority or subordination\u201d  (712-13).

The medieval Church, \nSmith boldly suggests, was \u201cthe most formidable co mbination that ever was \nformed\u2026against the liberty, reason, and happiness of mankind\u201d ( WN 802-\n3). It controlled large tracts of land ; like the lords, it gained political \nauthority by distributing agricultural surpluses (\u201cprofuse hospitality\u201d and \u201cextensive charity\u201d).

Rather, Smith formulates the phrase to help his 18th-\ncentury (and beyond) readers see reassuring types of societal order. Contra \nGrampp, the invisible hand does represent something \u201cso complex and so \ngrand as the social order\u201d (Grampp 446).  That order is not only broader than the inducement to employ capital domestically (supporting national defense), it is broader than Hayekian spontaneous order.  For Smith, the order within a system of natural liberty is but one realm of invisible-hand \ndialectics. \nWealth of Nations  innovates by depicting societal order in totally \nsecular terms. But by invoking an invisible hand that leads  people (he does \nnot say that we are led \u201cas if\u201d by an invisible hand), Smith alludes to divine action. He thus invites attentive readers to focus on the book\u2019s treatment of \nreligion, to notice the absence of God, and to co ntemplate the viability of \nboth atheistic ( WN) and theistic ( TMS ) worldviews.\n38 Only Moral Sentiments  \nattributes an Author to nature, and some of the differences between the \ntwo books may signal that Smith has us ed \u201cinvisible\u201d authorial skills to \n\u201clead\u201d his readers, especially when he appeals to God or nature as \nauthorities .39\n                                                                                        \n38 One can also approach the religious clash between WN and TMS  by recalling the elusive \ndialectic TMS  presents (in its invisible-hand chapter) between the \u201cphilosophical\u201d view that \ncondemns wealth/greatness and the \u201ccomplex\u201d view that celebrates them. The complex \nview emerges when \u201cour imagination\u201d leads us to confuse the \u201creal satisfaction\u201d that \nwealth/riches and greatness/power provide with \u201cthe order, the regular and harmonious \nmovement of the system, the machine or oeconomy\u201d by which that satisfaction is produced (TMS  183). By highlighting our proclivity to become intoxicated by machines, Smith\u2019s \n\u201cphilosophical\u201d critique of wealth and greatness might even prompt us to question the \ntheism Smith celebrates in his essays (and in TMS ); the theistic philosophers, analogizing \nfrom the unity and order of the machines that human beings create, portrayed the universe \nas \u201ca complete machine\u201d ( History of Ancient Physics 113-14). Let me suggest one more \nconundrum. Insofar as Smith equates machines with \u201csystems\u201d ( TMS  183, History of \nAstronomy 66, History of Ancient Physics 113) his \u201cphilosophical\u201d critique of trinkets also poses \na challenge to his own endeavors in formulating \u201csystems\u201d of political economy, moral \nphilosophy, and jurisprudence ( TMS  233-34, 265, 313-14, 340-42; WN 233, 606, 679, 687, \n768-69, 780-81, 794). On the other hand, intell ectual systems that resemble machines would \npresumably excel in precision, cohesion, relia bility, and efficacy. Given the high standards \nthat Smith thus set for himself, finally, perhaps Grampp (and other scholars) should work \nharder before concluding that Smith was a sloppy thinker or writer. \n39 The invisible hand can also remind us that, like our primitive ancestors, we are still prone \nto attribute agency to non-human powers that render us perplexed and puny. \n409                                                                           VOLUME 1, NUMBER 3, DECEMBER 2004", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3585, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e62dc45f-8e9d-4009-a2f1-8581a6ea956b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e62dc45f-8e9d-4009-a2f1-8581a6ea956b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42277f85-85c9-4499-9b5b-97a01726288a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "hash": "bcc3d4401fdb37522c9a81f83ffafff83ab57e315c4304700b750f7a7ca26882", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "PETER MINOWITZ  \nSmith\u2019s essay on \u201cthe principles which lead and direct philosophical \nenquiries\u201d incorporates rhetoric into its definition of science/philosophy. \nIn a section that introduces his lengthy assessment of astronomy, Smith \nstates that philosophy is \u201cthe science of the connecting principles of \nnature\u201d; \u201cby representing the invisible chains which bind together\u201d the disjointed objects and events we en counter, philosophy tries to introduce \norder into the \u201cchaos of jarring and discordant appearances,\u201d to restore the \nmind to \u201ctranquillity and composure\u201d (History of Astronomy 45-6). Just as \nsome readers of Wealth of Nations  doubt the existence of an invisible hand \nthat leads people to promote beneficial ends, some readers of the astronomy and physics essays may be led to doubt whether human beings \ncan attain knowledge  of invisible chains  that allegedly unify the cosmos. Smith \nproceeds to describe the historical essays in the following terms: \u201cLet us\u201d examine the different philosophical systems \u201cwithout regarding\u2026their \nagreement or inconsistency with truth and reality.\u201d Smith will merely assess \n\u201chow far each of them was fitted to sooth the imagination, and to render \nthe theater of nature a more coherent, and therefore a more magnificent spectacle.\u201d This rhetorical dimension, he adds, is what determines whether the authors \u201csucceeded in gaining reputation and renown\u201d; no system could \nattain \u201cgeneral credit\u201d unless its \u201cconnecting principles\u201d were \u201cfamiliar to \nall mankind\u201d (46).\n40 After the long history of astronomy that culminates in \neffusive praise for the system of Isaac Newton, Smith concludes by apologizing, somewhat histrionically, for having ever implied that the \u201cconnecting \nprinciples\u201d Newton presented were \u201cthe real chains which Nature makes \nuse of to bind together her several operations\u201d (105).\n41 \n As a reformer confronting a variety of powerful prejudices and \ninterests that would insp ire opposition to the new system of political \neconomy he offers to the world, Smith might have felt compelled to employ exaggeration, irony, and other tools of persuasion: \u201cIf the rod be bent too much one way, says the proverb, in order to make it straight you must bend it as much the other\u201d ( WN 664). If \u201c[a] philosopher is company \n                                                                                        \n40 The astronomy essay includes another remark that one can apply to the invisible hands of \nWN and TMS : in approaching a \u201cstrange\u201d subject, Smith says, a writer could draw an \nanalogy from a \u201cfamiliar\u201d one, creating not just \u201ca few ingenious similitudes\u201d but a \u201cgreat \nhinge upon which every thing turned\u201d (47). \n41 If Smith in the 1750s was hesitant to claim that Newton had revealed the real but invisible \nchains that would \u201cbind together\u201d the movements of the planets, did Smith in 1776 believe that he himself had revealed a real but invisible hand that \u201cled\u201d lords, merchants, and others \nunwittingly to advance the \u201cinterest of the society,\u201d the \u201cmultiplication of the species\u201d ( TMS  \n185), \u201cthe publick interest\u201d (WN  456) and the wealth of nations? In any case, Smith has left \nhis readers with the additional challenge of reconciling natural chains with natural liberty . \nECON JOURNAL WATCH                                                                                                           410", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3395, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31c54cde-37c2-4019-81b3-40fcdad1e16a": {"__data__": {"id_": "31c54cde-37c2-4019-81b3-40fcdad1e16a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6342a9d1-9630-4c35-815d-b4cfdc3c1eb5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kiratarora/Desktop/practice/github repo/data/ejw_com_dec04_minowitz.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292013, "creation_date": "2024-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-23"}, "hash": "962218c9957a5f4da6d32a0dcbbd77cf019adcc63caba32c4e4115108096ff27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "INVISIBLE HAND \nto a philosopher only\u201d ( TMS  34), a philosopher\u2019s books won\u2019t always \nbroadcast all of the complexities and uncertainties that fill that \nphilosopher\u2019s mind.
